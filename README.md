# Titanic Dataset: Survival Analysis & EDA 🚢

![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg/1200px-RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger survival using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data visualization. Developed during my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, it demonstrates hands-on skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Women were 4x more likely to survive** than men (74% vs 19%)
- **1st-class passengers had 62% survival rate** vs 24% for 3rd-class
- **Children under 10** had higher survival rates
- **Family size** impacted survival (neither too small nor too large was ideal)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## 📂 Files
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook with visualizations  
- `train.csv`: Original training dataset  
- `test.csv`: Test dataset  
- `gender_submission.csv`: Sample submission file  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
